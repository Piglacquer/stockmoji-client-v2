## Description

Stockmoji is a application built for you, the market-inclined individual, who has trouble parsing through all of the market news to see whether the outlook of a particular stock is good, bad, or uncertain (yeah, it's uncertain a lot of the time). The sentiments gleaned from all these different sources are condensed into emojis, the language of choice for millenials and beyond.

The basis of this application comes from a few API calls that the user initiates when they enter a stock ticker, Google Cloud Language API, Twitter, and IEX. These get the user some data about the company they entered, including basic information about the company, price data from the last 100 days, the top 100 tweets regarding the ticker, and the sentiment score of those tweets. This lets you glean some  information about that stock that could benefit you in your research endeavours.
